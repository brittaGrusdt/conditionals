```

Cost of conditional utterance: c

* cost(literal) = 0
* cost(conjunction) = c/2
* cost(negation) = c/4
* cost(maybe) = c/5

Cost for negation is only added once, also when both propositions are negated,
otherwise *If not A, not C* would be more expensive than *If not A, C* ...


The following data shows the mean of the speaker's marginal probabilities to
utter each utterance - considering all Bayes nets for which that utterance is
true.

```{r}
data <- readRDS("../../data/precomputations/model-general/utt-cost.rds")
data
